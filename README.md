# C-Cplusplus-Course-Projects

## Background
I am currently enrolled in a C++ course.  We are using a text book in the class, and we are covering the first half of the book in C++ I and will cover the second half of the text book in C++ II.

## Goal
I am coming to the C++ course with a little knowledge of C and no knowledge of C++.  I thought it would be fun to write all the projects in the text book in C and C++.  It is my hope that the process will improve my both my C and C++ understanding.
